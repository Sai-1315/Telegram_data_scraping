Features
Asynchronous Scraping: Leverages Python's asyncio and Telethon for efficient, non-blocking scraping.
Media Support: Collects messages and attached media (e.g., images, videos, and documents) and stores them locally.
Error Management: Handles common issues like rate limits (FloodWaitError) and two-factor authentication gracefully.
Customizable Settings: Allows fine-tuning of scraping parameters like group/channel names, message limits, and scraping intervals.
Data Consolidation: Combines multiple output CSV files into a single, unified dataset for analysis.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or later
Required libraries:
Telethon
nest_asyncio
Additional optional libraries for visualization (e.g., matplotlib)
Install all dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sai-1315//Telegram_Scraper.git
cd telegram-scraper
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Set Up Your API Credentials
Obtain your API ID and API Hash from the Telegram API.
Replace placeholders in the script (api_id, api_hash, and phone_number) with your credentials.
2. Run the Session Generator
Run the session generator script to log in to Telegram and save your session string:

bash
Copy code
python 01-Telegram Session Generator.py
Follow the on-screen instructions for authentication.

3. Start Scraping
Run the main scraper script to collect messages and media:

bash
Copy code
python 02-Telegram Scraper.py
4. Merge Data
After scraping, consolidate the data into a single CSV file:

bash
Copy code
python 03-merge_output_files.py
Configuration
Customize these parameters in Telegram Scraper.py:

API Credentials:
Replace placeholders for api_id and api_hash with your Telegram API credentials.
Session String:
Use the session string generated by the 01-Telegram Session Generator.py script.
Scraping Parameters:
group_title: Name of the target Telegram group or channel.
limit_msg: Maximum number of messages to fetch per request.
Repeat_number: Number of iterations for repeated scraping.
datetime_before: Timestamp for fetching messages from a specific date.
How It Works
1. Session Management and Login Authentication
Handles login via Telethon, including two-factor authentication if enabled. Saves the session string for reuse.

2. Main Scraper: Data and Media Collection
Fetches messages and media from groups or channels using Telethon's GetHistoryRequest. Manages rate limits (FloodWaitError) by pausing when necessary.

3. Data Merging
Combines multiple CSV files created during scraping into a single dataset for easier analysis and visualization.

Error Handling
The scraper includes robust error handling:

FloodWaitError: Automatically waits for the required duration before retrying.
SessionPasswordNeededError: Prompts for a two-factor authentication password if necessary.
General Exceptions: Catches and logs unexpected issues to ensure smooth operation.
Best Practices and Tips
Avoid Overloading Telegram Servers: Use reasonable message limits and intervals to stay within Telegram's rate limits.
Monitor the Process: Regularly check the scraping output to ensure data integrity.
Handle Interrupted Sessions: Use the last file's timestamp to continue scraping from where it left off.
Stay Ethical: Ensure compliance with Telegram's terms of service and privacy guidelines.
